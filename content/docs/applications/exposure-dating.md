# Surface exposure dating using terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides 
## Overview
Exposure age dating of geological surfaces using _in situ_ terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides, first proposed by \citet{davisandschaeffer55}, is now a commonly applied geochronological method used to date geomorphic events that have created distinct terrestrial landforms composed of previously unexposed geological material \citep{gosseandphillips01}. _In situ_ terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (henceforth _cosmogenic nuclides_) are rare isotopes (e.g. <sup>10</sup>Be, <sup>36</sup>Cl, <sup>3</sup>He, <sup>26</sup>Al) of elements common on Earth, which are produced in rock-forming minerals at the Earth's surface via nuclear reactions with a secondary cascade of high-energy particles (neutrons and muons), originating from primary galactic cosmic radiation \citep{gosseandphillips01}. Measurements of the concentration of a stable cosmogenic nuclide (e.g. <sup>3</sup>He, <sup>21</sup>Ne) in a mineral sample (_N_) therefore represent a proxy for surface residence time, which can be converted into an exposure age ($T_{exp}$):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:expage}
T_{exp} = \frac{N}{P}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the production rate of the measured nuclide scaled to the sample site (see below). This equation assumes no post-depositional erosion (i.e. loss of nuclides) and no inheritance of nuclides from prior exposure. For radionuclides (i.e. $^{10}$Be,  $^{26}$Al,  $^{36}$Cl) age calculations must account for radioactive decay using the relevant decay constant \citep{gosseandphillips01}.\\

## Cosmic radiation and nuclide production
Primary galactic cosmic radiation at the top of the atmosphere consists primarily of protons (c. 83 \%) and alpha-particles (c. 13 \%) and predominantly originates within the Milky Way \citep{gosseandphillips01}. The primary ray flux is modulated by Earth's magnetic field and, to a lesser extent, solar activity. Primary ray particles are deflected by the geomagnetic field and only penetrate when momentum exceeds the \emph{cutoff rigidity}, which is a product of the incident angle and position relative to the geomagnetic field \citep{gosseandphillips01}. Thus, primary ray production is spatially heterogeneous. For example, incoming particles require greater energies to overcome the geomagnetic field at lower latitudes compared to high latitudes, as geomagnetic field lines near the equator are orientated approximately perpendicular to the average incident angles of incoming primary rays. Particles that overcome this barrier collide with atomic nuclei in the atmosphere to initiate a cascade of secondary radiation. Successive reactions in this cascade reduce the number and energies of secondary rays that reach Earth's surface. The neutron flux at the Earth's surface decreases exponentially with increasing rock/soil depth, such that at depths of c. 2.5 - 3 m the flux is reduced to $<$1\% of that at the surface \citep{dunai10}. Attenuation of the neutron flux with depth is dependent on the density of the overlying material and the energy of the incoming neutron. Production of cosmogenic nuclei in a host rock predominantly (c. 98\%) occurs via spallation, where fast and high energy neutrons and muons strike and disintegrate target nuclei \citep{dunai10}. A separate mechanism for cosmogenic nuclide production is thermal neutron capture. This occurs when incoming neutrons are slowed down to thermal energies (c. $<$ 0.5eV) and become absorbed by target nuclei \citep{gosseandphillips01}. Cosmogenic nuclide production via this mechanism varies between nuclides, depending on the abundance and cross sections of target nuclei \citep{dunai10}. \\

Accurate and precise determination of an exposure age from a given cosmogenic nuclide concentration requires accurate and precise knowledge of the rate of cosmogenic nuclide production ($P$: Eq. \ref{eq:expage}) at the specific sample site. As outlined above, $P$ at earth's surface varies in time and space predominantly due to variances of the geomagnetic field and surface elevation. Several, commonly applied, physically-based numerical descriptions of these processes exist to predict $P$ at a given atmospheric depth and position relative to the geomagnetic field \citep{lal91,stone00,dunai01,liftonetal05,desiletsetal06, balcoetal08}. Minor differences in the treatment of magnetic field variability, atmospheric depth and solar variability between these models, results in different estimates of $P$ for the same sample position \citep{balcoetal08}. Typically cosmogenic surface exposure ages are reported using all of these scaling schemes, however a single scaling scheme may be preferred where production rates have been derived using an independent geochronometer (e.g. radiocarbon), thereby allowing comparison between scaling methods. For example, in the Southern Alps, $^{10}$Be exposure ages calculated using the modified, time-dependent \citet{lal91}/\citet{stone00} scheme (commonly referred to as '\emph{Lm}' after \citealp{balcoetal08}) produced the best match to associated, independent radiocarbon chronologies \citep{putnametal10pr}.\\

The established scaling schemes require a reference value for $P$, which refers to production of the given nuclide at sea-level and high latitude (SLHL). These reference values are derived from empirical calibration studies, where the concentration of the cosmogenic nuclide of interest is measured in a surface of known age (e.g. \citealp{putnametal10pr, goehringetal10}). Local production rates derived using such an approach are normalised to SLHL ($P_{SLHL}$) using each of the scaling schemes, for subsequent applications. Where available, locally calibrated production rates minimise the uncertainties that arise from production rate scaling. % An alternative is to take the average results from all studies that have calculated (_P_<sub>_SLHL_</sub>), assuming the differences between individual values arise from measurement uncertainty alone (e.g. \citealp{balcoetal08}). In either case, it is imperative in any surface exposure dating application that the scaling scheme used to derive (_P_<sub>_SLHL_</sub>), is the same as that used to calculate production at the study site of interest \citep{balco11}. 
To aid this process and to help ensure internal consistency between applications, publicly-available cosmogenic exposure age calculators have been produced for individual nuclides (e.g. \citealp{balcoetal08} for $^{10}$Be and $^{26}$Al; \citealp{goehringetal10} for $^3$He). These tools allow users to generate exposure age datasets for measurements of the given nuclides, according to the scaling schemes listed above. Furthermore, site-specific influences on $P$ derived from field observations, such as erosion rates, local shielding by surrounding topography and sample thickness, can also be included in the exposure age calculation. \\
