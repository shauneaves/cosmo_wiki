# Surface exposure dating using terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides 
## Overview
Exposure age dating of geological surfaces using _in situ_ terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides, first proposed by \citet{davisandschaeffer55}, is now a commonly applied geochronological method used to date geomorphic events that have created distinct terrestrial landforms composed of previously unexposed geological material \citep{gosseandphillips01}. _In situ_ terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (henceforth _cosmogenic nuclides_) are rare isotopes (e.g. <sup>10</sup>Be, <sup>36</sup>Cl, <sup>3</sup>He, <sup>26</sup>Al) of elements common on Earth, which are produced in rock-forming minerals at the Earth's surface via nuclear reactions with a secondary cascade of high-energy particles (neutrons and muons), originating from primary galactic cosmic radiation \citep{gosseandphillips01}. Measurements of the concentration of a stable cosmogenic nuclide (e.g. <sup>3</sup>He, <sup>21</sup>Ne) in a mineral sample (_N_) therefore represent a proxy for surface residence time, which can be converted into an exposure age ($T_{exp}$):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:expage}
T_{exp} = \frac{N}{P}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the production rate of the measured nuclide scaled to the sample site (see below). This equation assumes no post-depositional erosion (i.e. loss of nuclides) and no inheritance of nuclides from prior exposure. For radionuclides (i.e. $^{10}$Be,  $^{26}$Al,  $^{36}$Cl) age calculations must account for radioactive decay using the relevant decay constant \citep{gosseandphillips01}.\\

## Cosmic radiation and nuclide production
Primary galactic cosmic radiation at the top of the atmosphere consists primarily of protons (c. 83 \%) and alpha-particles (c. 13 \%) and predominantly originates within the Milky Way \citep{gosseandphillips01}. The primary ray flux is modulated by Earth's magnetic field and, to a lesser extent, solar activity. Primary ray particles are deflected by the geomagnetic field and only penetrate when momentum exceeds the \emph{cutoff rigidity}, which is a product of the incident angle and position relative to the geomagnetic field \citep{gosseandphillips01}. Thus, primary ray production is spatially heterogeneous. For example, incoming particles require greater energies to overcome the geomagnetic field at lower latitudes compared to high latitudes, as geomagnetic field lines near the equator are orientated approximately perpendicular to the average incident angles of incoming primary rays. 

Particles that overcome this barrier collide with atomic nuclei in the atmosphere to initiate a cascade of secondary radiation. Successive reactions in this cascade reduce the number and energies of secondary rays that reach Earth's surface. The neutron flux at the Earth's surface decreases exponentially with increasing depth, such that at rock depths of c. 2.5 - 3 m the flux is reduced to $<$1\% of that at the surface \citep{dunai10}. Attenuation of the neutron flux with depth is dependent on the density of the overlying material and the energy of the incoming neutron. 

Production of cosmogenic nuclides in a host rock predominantly (c. 98\%) occurs via spallation, where fast and high energy neutrons and muons strike and disintegrate target nuclei \citep{dunai10}. A separate mechanism for cosmogenic nuclide production is thermal neutron capture. This occurs when incoming neutrons are slowed down to thermal energies (c. $<$ 0.5eV) and become absorbed by target nuclei \citep{gosseandphillips01}. Cosmogenic nuclide production via this mechanism varies between nuclides, depending on the abundance and cross sections of target nuclei \citep{dunai10}. \\

Accurate and precise determination of an exposure age from a given cosmogenic nuclide concentration requires accurate and precise knowledge of the rate of cosmogenic nuclide production ($P$: Eq. \ref{eq:expage}) at the specific sample site. As outlined above, $P$ at earth's surface varies in time and space predominantly due to variances of the geomagnetic field and surface elevation. Several, commonly applied, physically-based numerical descriptions of these processes exist to predict $P$ at a given atmospheric depth and position relative to the geomagnetic field \citep{lal91,stone00,dunai01,liftonetal05,desiletsetal06, balcoetal08}. Minor differences in the treatment of magnetic field variability, atmospheric depth and solar variability between these models, results in different estimates of $P$ for the same sample position \citep{balcoetal08}. Typically cosmogenic surface exposure ages are reported using all of these scaling schemes, however a single scaling scheme may be preferred where production rates have been derived using an independent geochronometer (e.g. radiocarbon), thereby allowing comparison between scaling methods. For example, in the Southern Alps, $^{10}$Be exposure ages calculated using the modified, time-dependent \citet{lal91}/\citet{stone00} scheme (commonly referred to as '\emph{Lm}' after \citealp{balcoetal08}) produced the best match to associated, independent radiocarbon chronologies \citep{putnametal10pr}.\\

The established scaling schemes require a reference value for $P$, which refers to production of the given nuclide at sea-level and high latitude (SLHL). These reference values are derived from empirical calibration studies, where the concentration of the cosmogenic nuclide of interest is measured in a surface of known age (e.g. \citealp{putnametal10pr, goehringetal10}). Local production rates derived using such an approach are normalised to SLHL ($P_{SLHL}$) using each of the scaling schemes, for subsequent applications. Where available, locally calibrated production rates minimise the uncertainties that arise from production rate scaling. % An alternative is to take the average results from all studies that have calculated (_P_<sub>_SLHL_</sub>), assuming the differences between individual values arise from measurement uncertainty alone (e.g. \citealp{balcoetal08}). In either case, it is imperative in any surface exposure dating application that the scaling scheme used to derive (_P_<sub>_SLHL_</sub>), is the same as that used to calculate production at the study site of interest \citep{balco11}. 

To aid this process and to help ensure internal consistency between applications, publicly-available cosmogenic exposure age calculators have been produced for individual nuclides (e.g. \citealp{balcoetal08} for $^{10}$Be and $^{26}$Al; \citealp{goehringetal10} for $^3$He). These tools allow users to generate exposure age datasets for measurements of the given nuclides, according to the scaling schemes listed above. Furthermore, site-specific influences on $P$ derived from field observations, such as erosion rates, local shielding by surrounding topography and sample thickness, can also be included in the exposure age calculation. 

## Applications

### Palaeoglaciology

Cosmogenic surface exposure dating is now firmly established as the primary geochronological tool for constraining pre-historic glacier and ice sheet changes (see review by \citealp{balco11}) as it is one of the few techniques that dates the deposition of clasts directly by ice. Glacial erosion and deposition, particularly within temperate glaciers, creates two main situations that can be exploited using cosmogenic nuclides to constrain the timing of past ice fluctuations. First, glaciers quarry and entrain material, which is transported and deposited at ice margins forming moraines. Once deposited, moraine boulders are exposed to the cosmic ray flux. Thus, cosmogenic nuclide concentrations of boulders on the crest of moraines that are now unoccupied by glaciers are assumed to represent the length of time since ice withdrew from that location. Second, temperate glaciers erode their bed through abrasion and quarrying, removing cosmogenic nuclide inventories that may have accumulated during prior periods of exposure to the cosmic ray flux. When the shielding ice mass retreats, abraded bedrock begins to accumulate cosmogenic nuclides. Thus, samples from such situations can also be used to infer the time since ice retreat. Since the 1980s, improvements in mass spectrometry, chemical preparation methods and understanding of cosmogenic nuclide production rates and scaling have revolutionised the ability to constrain the timing of past glacier and ice sheet variations \citep{balco11}. For example, the timing of glacier readvance in New Zealand during the late-glacial (c. 15-11 ka BP) represents a prominent case in point of how methodological improvements in cosmogenic surface exposure dating have helped to address key questions in palaeoclimatology (\citealp{dentonandhendy94,ivyochsetal99,kaplanetal10,putnametal10pr,putnametal10acr}, see Chapter 2).\\

#### Moraines
Application of cosmogenic surface exposure dating to moraine boulders, with the goal of dating past glacier fluctuations, involves two main assumptions. First, that the sampled surface has remained exposed to the cosmic ray flux in its current position and has not undergone surface erosion since deposition (i.e. glacier retreat). If this assumption is violated, the measured concentration of cosmogenic nuclides will return a surface exposure age for the boulder that is younger than the age of the parent moraine. Second, it is assumed that the sampled moraine boulder surface contained no measurable quantity of cosmogenic nuclides immediately prior to deposition. If this assumption is violated, the measured cosmogenic nuclide concentration will overestimate the time since glacier retreat.\\
\\
The fact that these assumptions do not always hold true was illustrated in the first application of this technique to date moraines. \citet{phillipsetal90} found that scatter in nuclide concentrations, outside of the measurement uncertainty, increased with the stratigraphic age of the parent moraine landforms. Furthermore, \citet{phillipsetal90} found an age reversal, whereby boulders from the stratigraphically oldest moraine returned exposure ages younger than those from a stratigraphically younger, cross-cutting landform. \citet{halletandputkonen94} developed a topographic diffusion model that simulates moraine cross profile evolution over time, based on the rate of sediment transference from the moraine crest to the moraine slopes. This model also included a boulder weathering component that simulated the shrinkage and eventual loss of moraine boulders due to sub-aerial and sub-surface weathering. Applying this model to the study site of \citet{phillipsetal90}, \citet{halletandputkonen94} found that a combination of moraine diffusion and boulder surface erosion could explain the observed distribution of cosmogenic surface exposure ages.\\ 
\\
Subsequent analyses of large datesets of cosmogenic surface exposure ages from moraine boulders and geomorphic process model experiments have shown that post-depositional disturbance (i.e. moraine and boulder erosion) is the most common source of scatter in cosmogenic moraine chronologies \citep{putkonenandswanson03, putkonenandoneal06, applegateetal08, heymanetal11, applegateetal12}. This is because moraines are unlithified and steep-sided at the time of ice withdrawal, and frequently form in environments where gravitational and climatic processes maintain an active land surface. In contrast, moraine boulders displaying evidence for inheritance of cosmogenic nuclides due to prior exposure are relatively rare in temperate glacial environments and often readily identifiable as outliers given a sufficient sample size \citep{putkonenandswanson03, heymanetal11, balco11}. \\
\\
It is important to note that moraine exposure age datasets exhibit scatter to varying degrees. The degree of scatter is a product of sample choices and the integrated effects of the aforementioned geological processes, with respect to time. Important parameters in moraine degradation models include boulder erosion rates and the proportionality constant, \emph{topographic diffusivity}. The latter represents the sediment transfer rate normalised by the surface slope. Thus the value of this parameter reflects propensity of the substrate to erode and propensity of local climate to cause erosion (e.g. precipitation, freeze-thaw cycles). The role of precipitation in eroding boulder surfaces and moraines is perhaps illustrated by the the excellent internal consistency of recent datasets derived from low precipitation (c. $<$1 m yr$^{-1}$) sites in the Southern Alps (e.g. \citealp{schaeferetal06,putnametal13ohau,kelleyetal14,schaeferetal14}). Understanding the range of potetial error sources in cosmogenic moraine chronology datasets is of vital importance when designing a sampling campaign and interpreting results that display scatter outside of the analytical uncertainty.\\
