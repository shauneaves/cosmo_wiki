### 1 First steps
_note: this is a work in progress and likely inaccurate_<br>
<br>
You will need
- a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- a text editor/IDE (notepad will do it, but others offer a bit more, e.g. [VisualCodeStudio](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
We will use the 'fork and pull' method of collaboration from: https://github.community/t/contributing-to-repositories-with-github-desktop/10210

#### First time editing the webpage

- In your web browser, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository to create a copy of the source files held in your own GitHub account
- Click the green `Clone or download` button on your forked repository and select `Open in Desktop` 
- GitHub Desktop will open and maybe ask you where you want to store the cloned files
- It may then ask you how you are planning to use the fork
  - choose 'To contribute...'

#### Done some editing before

- Open GitHub Desktop, ensure you are on the `main/master` branch, and 'fetch origin' then 'pull' any updates.
- Your local files should now be identical with this repository and you are ready to make more edits.

### 2 Editing
The webpages are written in Markdown, a very simple markup language that is quick and easy to learn. <br>
   > ***Useful markdown tips and tricks***
   > *Here are some resources:*
   > - [Good overview of Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
   > - [Embed a custom Google Map](https://tribulant.com/blog/wordpress/easy-embedding-a-google-map-with-multiple-markers-to-your-site/)
<br>

- In GitHub Desktop, click the 'Current branch' dropdown and then click 'New branch'. Give it your new branch an intuitive name for your edits (e.g. 'adding-person', or 'adding-publication')
- You are now ready to do make some changes to your local files. Things you might like to try are:
  - [Add a person](#add-a-person)
  - [Add a publication](#add-a-publication)
  - [Add a project](#add-a-project)
  - [Edit the documentation](#edit-the-documentation)




#### Add a person

- In your file explorer, navigate to the directory `content/people`
- Create a copy of the `jbloggs` directory and rename it with your first initial and surname (or that of the person you are adding)


##### Change profile photo

- In your new directory, replace `avatar.jpg` with a profile picture for the new person. Note: this file must be named `avatar.jpg`

##### Edit profile page

- Open the file `_index.md`, which holds the content for the profile page. It comprises several sections; most are self explanatory (e.g. `title`, `role`, etc) and/or have some further explanatory comments in the code
  -  `education`: you can add more qualifications by adding more `course:`, `institution:`, `year:` triplets for each qualification.
  -  `social`: similarly, multiple social media accounts can be represented by repeating `icon:`, `icon_pack:`, `link:`.
     -  learn more about icons [here](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/page-builder/#icons)
  - `user_groups:` choose the relevant user group for the person by replacing the [] with one of the following (note failure to do this will mean the person is not listed on the 'People' page:
    - Researchers (e.g. academic staff)
    - Grad Students (PhD/MSc/Summer Schol?)
    - Technicians (e.g. professional staff)
    - Visitors
    - Alumni (e.g. former lab members)
- once you are happy with your edits, follow [these instructions](#merge-changes-and-submit-pull-request) to merge your changes and submit them to be added to the website source files
